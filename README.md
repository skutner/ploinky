# Ploinky

Ploinky is a lightweight runtime for AI agents. It is technology‑agnostic: an agent can be implemented in any language as long as it reads from stdin and writes to stdout (a simple console process). Ploinky exposes that process as a terminal (Console) and also as a chat interface — the chat mirrors the same TTY stream for a nicer UX.

Beyond a single agent, Ploinky supports a multi‑agent workspace. Each agent runs in its own container. A local web router serves a simple web app and proxies API calls to the containers, so you can build applications that orchestrate multiple agents. A companion cloud component (in progress) will host multiple such custom apps, each with its own agents and routes.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Docker or Podman
- Git

## Getting started

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/PlonkyRepos/ploinky.git
cd ploinky
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/bin"

# Start the CLI
p-cli

# Enable an agent and start the workspace
enable agent my-agent
start my-agent 8088

# Web console (TTY + Chat)
console my-agent myPassword
```

## Core commands (in p-cli)

- `enable agent <name>`: register an agent in `.ploinky/agents` (creates a minimal manifest if missing).
- `start <staticAgent> <port>`: first run requires a static agent and port; subsequent runs can just use `start`.
  - Ensures all enabled agents are running and launches the Router on `<port>`.
  - Serves static files from the repository of `<staticAgent>`; non `/apis/...` paths are static.
- `console <name> <password> [port]`: start the WebConsole (TTY + Chat) for an agent.
- `cli <name> [args...]`: run the agent’s CLI command interactively.
- `shell <name>`: open interactive `/bin/sh` in the agent container.
- `stop`: stop containers recorded in `.ploinky/agents` (do not remove).
- `shutdown`: stop and remove containers recorded in `.ploinky/agents`.

## Notes

- Containers run with the workspace directory mounted read‑write at the same path inside the container.
- Ploinky’s `Agent` tools directory is mounted read‑only at `/Agent` in every container, providing a supervisor script and helpers.
- If an agent manifest lacks an `agent` command, the container runs `/Agent/AgentServer.sh` which supervises the default AgentServer and restarts it if it exits.

## Cloud (preview)

The cloud component will allow hosting multiple custom apps built on Ploinky, each with its own agents and routes.
